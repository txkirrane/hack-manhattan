		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chris,
Thanks for the comments. I like the iOS idea. 
We&#039;ll be working on developing new uses for our Neurosky headsets for Come Out &#038; Play: After Dark in Manhattan on July 13th, and hopefully for Maker Faire NYC as well. Check back with us!
Enjoy your XWave,
Crystal

		<description><![CDATA[Team,
This would make for an awesome iOS or Andriod app.  I have purchased the XWave EEG headset from PLX (which plugs into any iOS device&#039;s headset jack) and there are so far just a few games out there.
Going in this direction makes this available to tons more people.  This type of brain exercise is supposed to improve and strengthen parts of the brain especially in people with ADHD and other neurological challenges.  How about a separate kickstarter project for these apps and you can give the apps away to backers?  Thanks.
